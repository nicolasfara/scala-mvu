## Scala Model-View-Update

This is a simple implementation of the Model-View-Update pattern in Scala. It is based on the Elm Architecture, which is described in detail [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).  
In particular, this example is based on the [Model-View-Update (MVU) â€“ How Does It Work?](https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update) article by Thomas Bandt.
